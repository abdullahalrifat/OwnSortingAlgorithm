# OwnSortingAlgorithm
Just tried To Write A Sorting Algorithm that can sort in O(N) time .
Right Now the time limit is O(limit) and limit is the heighest number in the collection
and the second issue is memory it is taking more memory because i am using some library like Vector<int> to store some data's
